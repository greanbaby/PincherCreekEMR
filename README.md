# OSCAR EMR eForm

*QUESTION: Why should I care about this new eForm?*

*ANSWER: It is a more efficient and modern coding method (as of 2020) to get data from OSCAR into your eForm*


This OSCAR EMR FORM pulls patient data from the OSCAR EMR.
This form is meant to be a template to build upon with your own ideas.


*HOW DO I INSTALL THE OSCAR EMR FORM?*

These 4 files need to be imported to OSCAR to use the eForm that links to all parts of the OSCAR EMR:
1) OSCAR EMR FORM
2) OSCAR EMR JavaScript
3) oscar.jpg logo for top left
4) w3.css stylesheet

based on OSCAR
