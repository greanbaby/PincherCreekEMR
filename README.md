# PincherCreekEMR
Pincher Creek Alberta Canada Electronic Medical Record
This OSCAR EMR FORM pulls data and has buttons to link to all other parts of the EMR easily. 
This form is meant to be a template to build upon.
These 4 files need to be imported to OSCAR to use the eForm that links to all parts of the OSCAR EMR:
1) OSCAR EMR FORM
2) OSCAR EMR JavaScript
3) w3.css stylesheet
4) oscar.jpg logo for top left

based on OSCAR

and JavaScript

with TamperMonkey inside FireFox browser

and DBeaver Universal Database Tool
