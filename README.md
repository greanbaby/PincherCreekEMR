# OSCAR EMR eForm

*QUESTION: Why should I care about this new eForm?*

*ANSWER: All of the coding was built on purpose to be easy to copy/paste*

*It is a more modern coding method to get data from OSCAR into your eForm, compared to code currently being shared to do the same thing as of the year 2020-2021*

*It does not require you to learn jQuery or Bootstrap to modify this form easily for your needs*


This OSCAR EMR FORM pulls all of the patient data from the OSCAR EMR.

This is meant to be a template to build upon with your own ideas -- copy/paste whatever you need to build your own eForms.


*HOW DO I INSTALL THE OSCAR EMR FORM?*

These 4 files need to be imported to OSCAR to use the eForm that links to all parts of the OSCAR EMR:
1) OSCAR EMR FORM
2) OSCAR EMR JavaScript
3) oscar.jpg logo for top left
4) w3.css stylesheet

based on OSCAR
https://worldoscar.org/

and JavaScript
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

and W3.CSS styling
https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/

*Why W3.CSS?*
*Ease of use*
