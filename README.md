# OSCAR EMR eForm

*QUESTION: Why should I care about this new eForm?*

*ANSWER: It is a more efficient and modern coding method to get data from OSCAR into your eForm, compared to code currently being shared to do the same thing as of the year 2020-2021*


This OSCAR EMR FORM pulls patient data from the OSCAR EMR.
This form is meant to be a template to build upon with your own ideas.


*HOW DO I INSTALL THE OSCAR EMR FORM?*

These 4 files need to be imported to OSCAR to use the eForm that links to all parts of the OSCAR EMR:
1) OSCAR EMR FORM
2) OSCAR EMR JavaScript
3) oscar.jpg logo for top left
4) w3.css stylesheet

based on OSCAR
https://worldoscar.org/

and JavaScript
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

and W3.CSS styling
https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/

*Why W3.CSS?*
*Ease of use*
W3.CSS is a modern, responsive, mobile first CSS framework.

W3.CSS provides equality for all browsers: Chrome. Firefox. Edge. IE. Safari. Opera.

W3.CSS provides equality for all devices: Desktop. Laptop. Tablet. Mobile.
